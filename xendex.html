			<h1>Hyperlinks</h1>
		</head>
		<main>
			Knowing how to link your code to other documents is important
		<div id = "absolute">
			<h2>Absolute References</h2>
			
			<p> Absolure references are sometimes referred as external links and they connect pages in other domains. In the href attributeof the tag, the full URL of the page, image, or other source you would like to link to is specified. one example ay be the quest to list some of the greatest bakeries of al time. Since you want to link the bakeries themselves and not files you wrote, you would you an absolute reference.</p>
				<ul<
					<li><a href="http://washtenawdairy.com">WashtenawDairy</a><br></li>
					<li><a href="http://rosiescoffeebarandbakery.com">Rosie's Coffer Bar and Dairy</a><br></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.thedexterbakery.com">Dexter Bakery</a><br></li>
				</ul>
			<p>An advantage of absolute references is that you are always linked to the most Up-to-date information on that page. A disadvantage os that it is up to you to make sure that the links don't change.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id = "relative">
			<h2>Relative References</h2>
			<p> Relative references (sometimes called internal links) connect to pages in other domains. In the href attributes of the tag only the folder (if any) and filename is specified.Some of when you might use relative references would be in your navigation bar or links to your images.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href=html\images\04.jpg">Red elephant in blue</a><br></li>
				</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div id = "images">
			<h2>Images as Links</h2>
			<p>More and more people are moving away from textual prompts to ones that are based on graphics. This is because the pages looks 'nicer.'Redo the link above using a picture instead of words.<br>
				<a href="html\images\04.jpg">
					<img src="C:\Users\Masita\Desktop\html\images\04.jpg"width = "50%" alt = "Red elephant in blue">
				</a><br>
			</p>
			<p>Not every use is goingto see the image,or they may not relaise the image is a link. confidence in coding will help you get as many people as possible to test you pages so that you can make it optimal experience for as many people as possible.</p>
